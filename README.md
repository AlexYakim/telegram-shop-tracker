## ðŸš€ Features

- Store selection
- Add and remove items
- View current list
- FSM navigation between input stages
- Can be used by a small group to collaboratively manage shared shopping lists
- **Note:** Currently uses a JSON file as a temporary database. This means it is suitable for small-scale or shared group use only.
